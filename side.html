    <h1>HUMAN TRAFFICKING</h1>
    <h2>Prevention, Prosection and Prosecution.</h2>

    <p>
      How much would you pay for a winter coat? How much would you pay for the
      child that made it? Fifty years ago, the abomination of slavery seemed
      like a thing of the past. But history has a way of repeating itself.
      Today, we find that human slavery is once again a sickening reality. At
      this moment, men, women and children are being trafficked and exploited
      all over the world: 2.4 million have been trafficked into forced labour
      worldwide of these, 600,000 to 800,000 are trafficked across borders each
      year and 12,000 children are working as slaves on cocoa plantations in
      West Africa.

    It is impossible to ever reach a consensus on the true scale of the problem
    but, regardless of the figures, what matters is that human trafficking is
    big and getting bigger. What matters is that every number represents a human
    life destroyed. It is happening on every continent and in almost every
    country: whether the place we live is a source, destination or transit point
    for trafficking, none of us can claim to be wholly unaffected by this
    crime.As the extent of human trafficking is recognized, a number of
    approaches to tackling it have been developed. Stop the Traffik is one such
    approach. Born out of witnessing first-hand the effects of human
    trafficking, we started out in 2006 as an informal coalition dedicated to
    raising awareness of trafficking and generating the political will necessary
    to stop it. During our short existence we have found that one of the biggest
    impediments to anti-trafficking efforts is a lack of understanding of the
    issue. Trafficking, and consequently, the measures taken to combat it, is
    often entangled with people smuggling, immigration and asylum, prostitution
    and other forms of organized crime.

    <p>
      It must be emphasized that the essence of trafficking is the forced
      exploitation of individuals by those in the position to exert power over
      them. While moving people is an intrinsic part of trafficking, this may
      occur within as well as across borders, and it may take a variety of
      forms. If they have been tricked or deceived, a person may even willingly
      transport themselves into a situation of exploitation. But unlike those
      who pay to be smuggled into another country, victims of trafficking have
      no prospect of making a new life for themselves. International trafficking
      will inevitably raise issues of immigration, but its victims cannot simply
      be treated as illegal migrants, nor can the efforts to tackle it be
      reduced to stricter border controls. We can find sex trafficking abhorrent
      without taking a particular stance against prostitution, and policies to
      reduce or control the sex industry are just one approach to ending the
      trade of human flesh. Finally, despite the similarities between the
      organized trafficking of drugs, arms and humans, which may require
      comparable police tactics to combat, we commit a grave injustice against
      the victims of human slavery if we reduce them in our minds to the status
      of commodities. The first step to preventing human trafficking and
      prosecuting the traffickers is therefore to recognize the complexity of
      the crime which cannot be tackled in a vacuum. Anti-trafficking strategies
      have to be embedded in every policy area, from improving female education
      in source countries so that girls are less vulnerable to trafficking, to
      increasing police pay in destination countries so that officers are less
      susceptible to bribery. We cannot allow ourselves to marginalize the issue
      of trafficking, viewing it as something that can be ended with a few extra
      taskforces or dedicated units. We need everyone to be aware of how it
      affects them, and what they can do to stop it.

      Laudable efforts in this direction have already been made. In 2000, the
      United Nations launched the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish
      Trafficking in Persons, which established a victim-centred approach to
      trafficking. It has since been signed by 177 countries. In 2005, the
      Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings
      marked a step towards greater cooperation and dedication within Europe.
      But more needs to be done. Many people still do not know what trafficking
      is, or do not care. We are working to change that, at every level of
      society. In February 2008 we delivered 1.5 million signatures to the UN
      from people calling for an end to human trafficking; as a result, our
      founder Steve Chalke was appointed UN.GIFT Special Advisor on Community
      Action against Human Trafficking. Since then we have continued to build on
      our grassroots support, firm in the belief that trafficking cannot be
      stopped by international conventions alone. Our focus is currently geared
      towards three key campaigns. First is Start Freedom, our dynamic new
      global project run in conjunction with the UN that aims to engage and
      raise awareness among young people, helping them learn about the issues
      surrounding human trafficking. The fact that over half of all victims of
      human trafficking are under 18 empowers young people to realize the
      importance of their potential to prevent this illicit trade. Already we've
      had stories from source, transit and destination countries such as Greece,
      Mexico and Nepal, about how young & not;people, schools, faith groups and
      & not;communities are engaging with Start Freedom. Communities are at the
      heart of our campaigns. During Freedom Week in March 2010, young people
      will connect, engage and share in their communities varied and creative
      ways to mark their objection to human trafficking. Our other key project
      at the moment is Active Communities against Trafficking (ACT), which aims
      to bring together members of a community under the umbrella of an ACT
      group. We equip these groups with an abundance of resources to help them
      identify trafficking, understand how it affects local communities, and
      learn how to help prevent its continuation.

      They can do this by asking questions about missing children and by forming
      connections with local authorities, professionals and community leaders.
      We believe trafficking starts in a community, and can be stopped by a
      community, and as the ACT project takes hold across countries, we are
      witnessing the profile of trafficking being raised, bringing together a
      diversity of people to help combat human trafficking in its various
      guises. The second stage of ACT, currently being piloted, will be launched
      in 2010. It is essentially a community research project that aims to
      gather information about human trafficking for sexual exploitation in
      local communities. This project has strong potential to contribute
      immensely to our key objectives: prevention of trafficking, prosecution of
      traffickers and protection of victims.

      A third central focus is our Chocolate Campaign, which is informed by the
      fact that more than a third of the world's cocoa comes from Côte d'Ivoire,
      where child trafficking and forced labour has been widely documented and
      acknowledged by international initiatives, such as the International Cocoa
      Initiative. Since international deadlines for eradicating child
      trafficking were missed by manufacturers, we decided to campaign ourselves
      by trying to get the big chocolate manufacturers to tell us that their
      products are "traffik free". Up until very recently, most of them could
      not guarantee this -- quite simply because their supply chains were not
      free of child slavery. Our Chocolate Campaign encourages people to help
      spread awareness about child trafficking in the cocoa industry, and to
      pressurize big chocolate manufacturers to commit to certifications, such
      as Fair Trade or Rainforest Alliance, which are currently the best
      guarantees we have to indicate that products are "traffik free". Our
      campaign strategy relies on our numerous grassroots supporters: people
      host Fair Trade Chocolate Fondue fundraisers, send letters and make phone
      calls to manufacturers, boycott brands until they become Fair Trade, and
      hold awareness-raising events to inform and empower others to make ethical
      decisions. Our successes so far have been fantastic: Cadbury committed to
      a Fair Trade Dairy Milk, and Mars promised to certify the Galaxy bar with
      the Rainforest Alliance by 2010, and their whole range by 2020. Within a
      few weeks of targeting Nestlé to commit to a fair trade Kit Kat, we got
      news that they too were following suit in the United Kingdom by
      introducing a Fairtrade four-finger Kit Kat in January. This is a start,
      but it is nowhere near the end. Only with a concerted effort by
      governments, private companies, non-governmental organizations, and above
      all communities, can we hope to end the horror of human trafficking. Stop
      the Traffik has developed into an independent charity with over 1,500
      member organizations and hundreds of thousands of individuals around the
      world who refuse to tolerate the existence of slavery in the twenty-first
      century. People are talking, communities are rising, global networks are
      being forged and governments are responding to the united message that
      human trafficking must end.
